          <p>To maintain a safe environment for users on Enigma Tax, we may suspend accounts that violate the Enigma Tax Common reasons for suspension may include:</p>
          <p>Spam: Most of the accounts we suspend are suspended because they are spammy, or just plain fake, and they introduce security risks for all of our users. These types of accounts are against our Enigma Tax Rules. Unfortunately, sometimes a real person’s account gets suspended by mistake, and in those cases, we’ll work with the person to make sure the account is unsuspended.</p>
